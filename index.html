	<h3>											Cat's Food</h3>
	<p>
		Whether your cat is a picky eater or a little on the pudgy side, they probably let you know how they feel about what you put in their bowl.

	“Cats are very opinionated about food, and a lot of their food preferences are formed in the first year,” says Julie A. Churchill, DVM, PhD, associate professor of nutrition at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine in St. Paul. So if your cat is a kitten, now is the time to get them used to different types of food -- wet, dry, and semidry.

	But even if your pet is older, there are still ways to make sure they are getting all the nutrients they need to be healthy. Start by learning more about what you’re buying and what your cat needs.

	</p>
	<p>									What food do cats love the most?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Tuna,Open a can of tuna and you'll quickly see why it's one of the top foods cats love.</li>
		<li>Yogurt,Obviously, milk is a popular treat for cats, but they also love yogurt!.</li>
		<li>Ham.</li>
		<li>Salmon.</li>
		<li>Ice-Cream.</li>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong>The previous mentioned food is the Cat's Faviorate food,But it doesn't meant that is <strong> Healthy for cats.</strong> </p>
